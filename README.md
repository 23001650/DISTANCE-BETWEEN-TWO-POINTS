# DISTANCE-BETWEEN-TWO-POINTS

## AIM:
To write a python program to find the distance two 2 points
## ALGORITHM:
### Step 1: 
Import math moduleto use the build the functions for calculation  
### Step 2:
create 2 list for finding a distance between 2 points 
### Step 3: 
Substitute the values in the distance formula  ![formula](/formula.JPG)
### Step 4: 
Print the valu in 2 decimal points
### Step 5: 
End the program
### PROGRAM:
```

import math
list1=[4,2]
list2=[10,6]
distance=math.sqrt((list2[0]-list1[0])**2+(list2[1]-list1[1])**2)
print(round(distance,2))
```
